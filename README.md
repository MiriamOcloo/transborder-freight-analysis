Data analysis project using CRISP-DM for BTS freight data
## CRISP-DM Phase 1: Business Understanding

### Business Problem
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) seeks to improve the efficiency, planning, and decision-making related to transborder freight movement. To do this, they need insights into patterns and trends in the volume, value, origin, and cost of goods moved across U.S. borders using different modes of transportation. This project aims to help BTS identify inefficiencies, trends, and improvement opportunities using historical freight data.

### Analytical Questions

1. What are the top modes of transportation used for transborder trade by total value and shipping weight?
2. Which partner countries (e.g., Canada or Mexico) contribute most to trade in terms of value and volume?
3. How does the trade value and shipping weight vary across different months and years?
4. Whatâ€™s the difference in total value, shipping weight, and freight charges between domestic and foreign produced merchandise?
5. Which transportation mode incurs the highest average freight charges?
6. Are there notable trends in freight movement across different U.S. border states over time?
7. What are the most common trade types (import/export), and how do their values and weights compare over time?
